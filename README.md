# ðŸ’¼ Portfolio Redesign ðŸ’¼

### August 2023 - Present Edition

> This project started development around August 2023, when I was just finishing my 2nd semester in Computer Science and Engineering. Now, it is stil used as my main portfolio website and although there have been a lot of changes since its inception, I no longer consider it finished and tons of new features are planned to be added in the future. However, the current design has been in place for a while and I am quite happy with it.
